Key Points:      
      -The exercises completed are converted into exercise points, so that completing at least 10% of the exercises grants one point, 20% grants two points, and so forth. Completing all 100 exercises grants 10 exercise points. The number of exercise points granted is an integer value, rounded down.
      -Total possible points is 30
      -Grade scale goes from 5(highest) - 0(failed)
      -Scoring below a 10 on a exam is an automatic fail
