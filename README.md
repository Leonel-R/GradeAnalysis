# Grades Statistical Analysis
Program that takes score inputs to perform statistical analysis 

### Instructions:
1. Simply enter exam score (out of 20) and exercise score (out of 100) seperated by a space.

2. Enter as many exam/exercise score pairs as you would like.

3. Hit enter on an empty input to run statistical analysis on entered scores

### Key Points:      
* The exercises completed are converted into exercise points, so that completing at least 10% of the exercises grants one point, 20% grants two points, and so forth. Completing all 100 exercises grants 10 exercise points. The number of exercise points granted is an integer value, rounded down.
* Total possible points is 30
* Grade scale goes from 5(highest) - 0(failed)
* Scoring below a 10 on a exam is an automatic fail
